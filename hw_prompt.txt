Assignment: 
Create a New Flask Application

Objective: 
- Construct a fresh Flask application, different from the one we developed in class. This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of the creation process and deepen your familiarity with Flask.
Instructions:
1. Theme Selection: 
- Choose a theme for your collection to center your database around. Instead of 'posts', you could consider themes like Recipes, Cars, Movies, Wines, etc.
2. Data Structure: 
- For the chosen theme, decide on the appropriate key-value pairs that represent the attributes you'd wish to store. For instance, if you chose 'Movies', you might consider keys like 'title', 'director', 'release_date', etc.
3. CRUD Operations:
  - Collection: Ensure your application supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your data. This means you should be able to add, read, update, and delete the information.

BONUS points:

    incorporate users with CRUD functionality into your app and test routes/methods with Insomnia.
